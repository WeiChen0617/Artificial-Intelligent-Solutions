The objective of this project is to analyse a large dataset concerning human activity recognition. More specifically, the sensing signals, from accelerometer and gyroscope, is used to recognise human activities (e.g. walking, standing, and sitting etc.) and therefore the task is multi-class sequence classification problem.
