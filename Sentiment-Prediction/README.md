# Overview
We consider a real-life dataset consisting of 50,000 labeled gourmet food reviews from Amazon extracted from the work of McAuley and Leskovec1. A food review is labeled as 1 (positive) if it received four or more stars and 0 (negative) otherwise. The dataset is balanced and we provide two files (positive_reviews.csv and negative_reviews.csv) containing 25,000 positive and negative reviews respectively. The goal is to train machine learning (ML) models for sentiment prediction, evaluate them.

# Solutions of Sentiment Prediction

• Support vector machine with BOW and TF-IDF word features
